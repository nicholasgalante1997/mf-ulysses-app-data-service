# Section One: A New Delusion 

The van poured down the road at 98 mph, which was absurd for a van of that age and 
mileage to even attempt to do. This van had no regrets and a love for the hot sear of 
asphalt. It had witnessed it all; None of the beginning, some of the later middle, and it 
was here fucking soaring down the highway like a bird with the vigor of a internal combustion engine, well past the end. 

From what survived in writings of the beginning, to the later middle and end, the beginning seemed like more of the same with less of what's idiosyncratic today. Man, no; man and woman, wandered shit-dick lost and scared amidst the frightening strange, huddled within caves, scraping at cave walls with baretipped bleeding and muddy fingers, preserving the shit-dick life experience they knew, and didnt have a word to describe. 

Then came the great struggle, when man and woman settled down and had enough time before dying, that they could invent words like great, and struggle, and God, and pass it on to their proverbially, not so proverbial, incestuous children. So that they too could live in perpetual disdain, snowballing the inadequacies strewn forth from the lips of the original mother and father, to the now glorious, confusing, hateful, delusional, and nonsensical system of internal-sociopolitical-religious conscience that sits parasitically on our backs and courtrooms, guiding our least impactful decisions. That great and struggle and God period never really ended, but like the sons of Abraham or the Oxford Dictionary or the shoggoths of the briny deep, it multiplied forth in an oozing fractal separation into a million different periods that were all unique mirror images of one another. 

Let's say that the beginning ended in 1881. No reason why. There's no reason why for anything. The beginning spanned 99.99 percent of our shared history and its by far the most embarrassing and
